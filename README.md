# HUMAN FACE DETECTION USING PYTHON

Welcome to my face detection project, where I've harnessed the power of Python, Haar Cascade Frontal Face Detection, and the OpenCV library to create an impressive and reliable face detection system.

In this project, I've combined two formidable tools: the Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifier and the OpenCV library. OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, provides a versatile and robust foundation for developing image processing and computer vision applications. By integrating the Haar Cascade technique with OpenCV, I've crafted a highly effective and efficient face detection system.
